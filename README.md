# 🧠 Left-Handedness and Mortality Data Analysis 📊
## Project Overview

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/ranamuskaan/Healthcare-Project/blob/main/Healthcare_Project.png)

This data science project investigates the relationship between **left-handedness and age at death**, based on real data from a **National Geographic survey** and **US death distribution statistics**.

🔍 The goal is to understand whether left-handed individuals tend to live shorter lives than right-handed ones — and if so, why that might appear in historical data.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Task 1** | Load handedness data and create scatter plots |
| **Task 2** | Add birth year and average left-handedness columns |
| **Task 3** | Calculate P(LH | A) — Probability of being left-handed given age |
| **Task 4** | Load and visualize US death distribution data |
| **Task 5** | Compute overall left-handedness probability |
| **Task 6** | Calculate probability of being age A given you're left-handed |
| **Task 7** | Do the same for right-handed individuals |
| **Task 8** | Plot both probabilities vs. age |
| **Task 9** | Find mean age at death for left- vs. right-handed people |
| **Task 10** | Repeat the analysis using more recent data (2018) |

## 📈 Key Findings

- Left-handed individuals appear to have a **lower average age at death** in historical data.
- This is **not necessarily biological**, but due to **changes in social norms** (e.g., forced right-hand writing in schools).
- With time, **the apparent difference disappears**, confirming it's a **data artifact**, not a real health difference.
